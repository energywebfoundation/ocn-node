= Open Charging Network (OCN) Node Documentation

The following documentation provides usage details, with examples, for administrators and users of
an OCN Node. It assumes that the node has already been set up according to instructions provided in the
https://bitbucket.org/shareandcharge/ocn-node/src/develop/[repository].

== Health

The health endpoint can be used to ensure that the message broker is reachable via HTTP.

=== Request

include::{snippets}/health/http-request.adoc[]

=== Response

include::{snippets}/health/http-response.adoc[]


== Registry

The registry API provides helpful https://bitbucket.org/shareandcharge/ocn-node/issues[OCN Registry] queries. The
registry smart contract itself holds information about parties and nodes on the network. By extension, the following
API can be used to check whether the OCN Node has been correctly configured to interact with the registry smart
contract.

=== Get Node Information

This endpoint retrieves the publicly available information (root public URL, Ethereum wallet address) of a given OCN
Node. This information should match the OCN Registry listing of the OCPI party using the Node.

==== Request

include::{snippets}/registry/node-info/http-request.adoc[]

==== Response

include::{snippets}/registry/node-info/http-response.adoc[]

=== Get Party's Node Information

This endpoint is used to find the OCN Registry listing of a given party. Two url path variables should be provided:
the OCPI `country_code` and `party_id`.

==== Request

include::{snippets}/registry/node-of/http-request.adoc[]

==== Response

include::{snippets}/registry/node-of/http-response.adoc[]



== Admin

The admin API allows administrators to manage their OCN Node. Currently, the only admin functionality is the generation
of new Open Charge Point Interface registration tokens (so-called `CREDENTIALS_TOKEN_A`) for interested platforms.

=== Request

include::{snippets}/admin/generate-registration-token/http-request.adoc[]

The Authorization header should be set in the format `Token ${api_key}`. The admin can find this in stdout when
the application runs (a new key will be generated each time unless specified in the application's properties file).

==== Body

include::{snippets}/admin/generate-registration-token/request-body.adoc[]

The request body is a list of a platforms' roles, containing their `party_id`
and `country_code`. This allows a platform with multiple OCPI roles (i.e. EMSP and CPO) to register on the
same OCPI connection.

=== Response

include::{snippets}/admin/generate-registration-token/http-response.adoc[]

The response contains the OCPI `TOKEN_A` and the message broker's versions endpoint, both of which are needed to
start the registration process.


== Open Charge Point Interface

The Open Charge Point Interface enables eMobility platforms to connect to one another. The Open Charging Network
uses this as it's primary means of connecting such parties. It is important to have developed an OCPI version 2.2
API beforehand, in order to connect to and use an OCN Node. This comprises, as a bare minimum, the credentials module.
Documentation for version 2.2 can be found on https://github.com/ocpi/ocpi[OCPI @ *GitHub*].

The node strives to provide all the functionality of OCPI, though there are currently some features missing:

- The `hubclientinfo` module is still work in progress.
- Hub-specific features such as broadcast push and intelligent routing are not included.

See the https://bitbucket.org/shareandcharge/ocn-node/issues[issues page] on Bitbucket for more.

== Pagination and Proxying Resources

The OCN handles OCPI pagination requests in a special way. When sending a paginated request, for example,
to get the first 50 locations from a Charge Point Operator, the CPO will respond with a `Link` header which
only their OCN Node will be able to access.

Because of this, the OCN Node must proxy this header. The sender will receive from their OCN Node a `Link`
header such as https://some.ocn-node.net/ocpi/sender/2.2/locations/page/2 which will correspond to the
original CPO resource, for example, https://some.cpo.com/ocpi/cpo/2.2/locations?offset=100&limit=100.

Other examples of resources which require proxying include the `Location` header returned from the POST method
of the cdrs receiver interface, as well as any `response_url` used in the commands and charging profiles
modules.

== Custom OCPI modules

The OCN supports the use of custom OCPI modules. Such modules can be registered with an OCN Node during
the credentials handshake.

When requesting version details from the node, the response will contain the following endpoints:

....
{
  "identifier": "custom",
  "role": "sender",
  "endpoint": "https://some.ocn-node.net/ocpi/custom/sender"
},
{
  "identifier": "custom",
  "role": "receiver",
  "endpoint": "https://some.ocn-node.net/ocpi/custom/receiver"
}
....

This acts as a wildcard for _all_ custom OCPI modules. Here's how it works:

1. CPO completes credentials handshake with OCN Node
    a. CPO fetches OCN Node versions, saves endpoint details for wildcard custom module
    b. OCN Node fetches CPO versions, saves endpoint details for `enriched-locations` custom module
2. CPO sends their custom module request to the OCN Node
    a. requests any HTTP method. If making a POST, PUT or PATCH request, the content-type should be application/json
    b. places module name as first path variable, followed by any additional variables required by the
custom module: https://some.ocn-node.net/ocpi/custom/receiver/enriched-locations/location1
    c. appends url-encoded queries and json body if necessary
3. OCN Node routes the message to recipient's OCN Node
    a. recipient's OCN Node looks up `enriched-locations` in recipient's endpoints
    b. recipient's OCN Node forwards the request to https://recipient.msp.com/ocpi/emsp/2.2/enriched-locations/location1

== _OcnRules_ module

*Module Identifier: `ocnrules`*

*Type*: Configuration Module

OCN Nodes provide an additional, optional OCPI module: _OcnRules_. This allows platforms to configure filtering
rules for their chosen OCN Node. Current filtering rules include: overriding OCN signature requirement preferences;
blacklisting and whitelisting. Note that the blacklist and whitelist cannot be active at the same time. If the
whitelist is active, all senders not on the whitelist will have their requests filtered by the OCN Node (they will not
reach the receiver). Likewise, if the blacklist is active, all requests will reach the platform except those from
senders specified on the blacklist.

The signature rules allows the default OCN signature header requirement of the OCN Node to be overruled by the receiving
platform. By default, the value will match that of the OCN Node. The platform can set signatures to be required even if
the OCN Node does not do so by default. Note that the other way is not possible - a platform cannot tell the OCN Node
to turn off signature verification.

=== Interfaces

The _OcnRules_ module only specifies a receiver interface, implemented by the OCN Node itself. Connected platforms
use this interface to update rules on their given OCN Node.
